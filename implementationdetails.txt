The main start point is main.py.

main.py:
This class handles all the UI interaction of the application.
upload_csv() --- diplays the csv as a pandas table to inspect.
upload_and_mine_csv() --- uses heuristic mining to generate a graph and displays a png created with graphviz.
export_current_image() --- exports the graph on display as 'graph_viz.png' to the desired location.
upload_dot() --- displays a graph described by the dot file with networkx. This function may be removed in the final version.

csv_reader.py:
read() --- handles the reading in of csv. translates into a list format of cases.
The delimiter in the save file is now ','. So any event name that has this symbol in it will cause problems.

heuristic_mining():
The heuristic mining algorithm only needs 2 matrices and 1 list. 
The succession matrix, dependency matrix and event list.
Therefore a seperate class for the datatype was not necessary.
create_dependency_graph_with_networkx() --- returns a networkx graph
create_dependency_graph_with_graphviz() --- returns a graphviz graph
