# Process-Mining-Visualization
Implementation of a desktop app for importing event logs, mining and visualizing process models by using different algorithms (like alpha miner, heuristic miner, inductive miner, fuzzy miner) and metrics for filtering nodes and edges on mined process models. Mined process models can be exported as images.

# Status
This project is at version 0.1.0
Ready for use. Hopefully no severe bugs.

The Heuristic Miner and Fuzzy Miner algorithms have been implemented.

# Ensure the virtual environment is installed. If it hasn't been already then:
Create a new directory, e.g venv and install the virtual environment using command:
```
pip install virtualenv
```

# Activate the virtual environment
Navigate to the main directory and confirm its name (in this case, 'venv', the second parameter), then execute:
```
python -m venv venv
```

Move to venv/Scripts/ then activate virtual environment(Windows) using command: 
```
source activate
```

# Requirements
Python version 3.10.7 ----- Older versions likely to work as well, but not tested.
Download Python from www.python.org

Graphviz
To install Graphviz, visit the Graphviz website (https://graphviz.org/) and download the appropriate installer for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions provided by the Graphviz project to install it on your system.

After installing Graphviz, open a new terminal or command prompt and run the following command to verify if the dot command is accessible:
```
dot -V
```
Add Graphviz to the PATH: If the dot command is not found, you need to add the Graphviz executables directory to the system's PATH environment variable. The steps to do this depend on your operating system:

    Windows: Open the "System Properties" window and go to the "Advanced" tab. Click on the "Environment Variables" button, find the "Path" variable in the "System variables" section, and edit it. Add the directory containing the Graphviz executables (e.g., C:\Program Files\Graphviz\bin) to the list of paths. Click "OK" to save the changes.
    Linux/macOS: Edit the .bashrc or .bash_profile file in your home directory (or the appropriate shell configuration file for your shell). Add the following line at the end of the file, replacing /path/to/graphviz/bin with the actual path to the Graphviz executables:
    ```
    export PATH="/path/to/graphviz/bin:$PATH"
    ```
    Save the file and restart the terminal for the changes to take effect.

Other required Python libraries are in requirements.txt and can be installed with
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage Interface
Open a CMD in THIS folder and type 
```
python main.py
```

It will open a desktop application.
The lower right button lets you select a CSV file and mine it. Your CSV data will be saved for later.
The lower left button lets you load saved data, if you have any.

There are also the 'export png' and 'export svg' options under 'File', that lets you export the image on display as 'graph_viz.png' or 'graph_viz.svg'.

### How to run unit tests?

e.g. If you want to run unit tests of `heuristic_mining_test.py`, just type the command below:

```
python -m unittest tests.heuristic_mining_test
```

in THIS folder.

# Building on this project
If you want to add your own algorithm to this project, you need to create 2 files minimum.
1. Your [algorithm].py file in mining_algorithms (optional)
2. Your [algorithm]_view.py file in custom_ui (This is your own user interface that can call your algorithm)

In main.py you need to do the following:
1. Add your algorithm name to the 'algorithms' array.
2. Add your algorithm view to the 'algorithmViews' array

In your [algorithm]_view.py file:
1. inherit from algorithm_view_interface.py like in heuristic_graph_view.py
2. The export svg/png/dot functions in export_view.py only copy graphviz.[file extension] from the temp folder to the desired destination. It is your responsibility to generate those files in the functions required by algorithm_view_interface.py
