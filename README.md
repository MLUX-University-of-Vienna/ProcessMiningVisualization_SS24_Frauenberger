# Process-Mining-Visualization
Implementation of a desktop app for importing event logs, mining and visualizing process models by using different algorithms (like alpha miner, heuristic miner, inductive miner, fuzzy miner) and metrics for filtering nodes and edges on mined process models. Mined process models can be exported as images.

# Status
